# Firebase Windows Build Fix

The Windows build is failing due to deprecated Firebase Auth APIs. Here are several solutions:

## Solution 1: Use Web Version (Recommended for now)

Since your app is primarily for Windows desktop, you can run it as a web app which will work perfectly with Firebase:

```powershell
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8080
```

Then open: http://localhost:8080 in your browser

## Solution 2: Fix Windows Build

Add this to your `windows/runner/CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
# Add compiler flags to treat warnings as non-fatal
target_compile_options(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE /W3)
```

Or modify the build settings to ignore the deprecated API warnings.

## Solution 3: Use Alternative Auth (Temporary)

If you need Windows native builds immediately, you can:

1. Temporarily disable Firebase Auth on Windows
2. Use web-based auth fallback
3. Wait for Firebase Auth Windows plugin updates

## Current Status

- ✅ Firebase configuration is complete and working
- ✅ Web version should work perfectly
- ⚠️ Windows native build needs deprecated API fix
- ✅ All other platforms should work fine

## Recommended Action

Use the web version for now as it provides the same functionality and Firebase integration works perfectly on web.
