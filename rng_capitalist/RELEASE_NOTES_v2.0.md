# RNG Capitalist - Version 2.0 Release Notes

## ðŸš€ Major Features Added

### Enhanced Budget Logic
- **Remaining Budget System**: Decisions now based on `Available Budget - Fixed Costs`
- **Pure Price Ratio**: Removed 15% base threshold for more intuitive control

- **Default 100%**: Pure price ratio as baseline
- **0% Mode**: Always approve purchases
- **300% Mode**: Extremely strict approval

## ðŸŽ¯ How the New Oracle Works

### Decision Formula
```
Remaining Budget = Available Budget - Fixed Costs
Price Ratio = Item Price Ã· Remaining Budget
Decision Threshold = Strictness Ã— Price Ratio
Random Roll vs Threshold â†’ BUY IT or SKIP IT
```

### Example Scenarios
- **Item costs 25% of remaining budget at 100% strictness**: 25% threshold
- **Same item at 200% strictness**: 50% threshold (much harder to approve)
- **Same item at 0% strictness**: 0% threshold (always approved)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### User Interface
- **Green highlighting** for remaining budget field
- **Tooltips** on edit and delete buttons
- **Improved spacing** and visual hierarchy
- **Better error handling** and validation

### Data Persistence

- **Purchase history** tracking up to 100 decisions
- **Fixed costs** automatically saved and loaded

## ðŸ“Š Statistics & History

### Enhanced Tracking

## ðŸŽ¨ Philosophy & Design

RNG Capitalist embraces **bounded rationality** - we have limited mental bandwidth for decisions. By externalizing purchase choices to a smart algorithm, we:

- **Reduce decision fatigue**
- **Minimize buyer's remorse**
- **Make spending more intentional**
- **Add an element of fun to budgeting**
