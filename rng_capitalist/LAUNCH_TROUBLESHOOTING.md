# 🔧 RNG Capitalist Launch Fix Guide

## 🚨 INSTALLER ISSUE RESOLVED

The original installer had a path issue. Here are your options:

## ✅ OPTION 1: Use the FIXED Installer (RECOMMENDED)
**File**: `RNG-Capitalist-v2.1-Installer-FIXED.exe`
- ✅ Properly detects executable location
- ✅ Sets correct working directory
- ✅ Creates functional shortcuts
- ✅ Handles all file dependencies

## ✅ OPTION 2: Manual Launch (IMMEDIATE FIX)
1. Go to your installation folder: `C:\Program Files\RNG Capitalist`
2. Run `launch_app.bat` (I've included this in the package)
3. This will find and launch the app correctly

## ✅ OPTION 3: Direct Launch from Build Folder
1. Navigate to: `RNG-Capitalist-v2.1-Secure\`
2. Run `launch_app.bat`
3. Or directly run `rng_capitalist.exe` from its folder

## 🔍 Why the Original Installer Failed

The issue was with the installer script's path assumptions:
- **Problem**: Installer assumed exe was in root directory
- **Reality**: Flutter builds create a complex directory structure
- **Fix**: New installer script searches for the actual exe location

## 📁 Correct File Structure

Your app needs these files in the same directory:
```
rng_capitalist.exe              (main executable)
flutter_windows.dll             (Flutter runtime)
*.dll files                     (various plugins)
data/
  ├── app.so                    (app code)
  ├── icudtl.dat               (internationalization)
  └── flutter_assets/
      ├── .env                  (your API keys)
      ├── assets/               (app resources)
      └── fonts/                (fonts)
```

## 🛠️ IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS

### Quick Test (Right Now):
1. Open File Explorer
2. Go to: `C:\Program Files\RNG Capitalist\`
3. Look for `rng_capitalist.exe` or run `launch_app.bat`

### Permanent Fix:
1. Uninstall current version (if needed)
2. Use `RNG-Capitalist-v2.1-Installer-FIXED.exe`
3. Follow installation prompts
4. Launch from desktop shortcut

## 🔧 Manual Shortcut Creation

If shortcuts don't work, create manually:
1. Right-click on desktop → New → Shortcut
2. Browse to actual `rng_capitalist.exe` location
3. Set working directory to the folder containing the exe

## 🚀 Testing Checklist

After installation:
- [ ] Executable file exists and runs
