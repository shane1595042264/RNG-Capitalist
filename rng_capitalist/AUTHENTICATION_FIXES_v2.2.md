# 🔐 RNG Capitalist v2.2 - Authentication System Fixed! 🔐

## ✅ **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

You were absolutely right! The authentication system was completely broken. Users were being auto-logged into an "Unknown" account without any choice. Here's what I fixed:

### 🚨 **What Was Wrong:**
1. **NO LOGIN SCREEN** - App went straight to main interface
2. **AUTO "Unknown" USER** - Created fake users automatically
3. **NO REAL AUTHENTICATION** - Users couldn't choose their username
4. **TERRIBLE LOGOUT UX** - Required app restart to switch accounts
5. **PREDETERMINED USERNAMES** - Users had no control over their identity

### 🛠️ **What I Fixed:**

#### 1. **Proper Login Flow**
- **Welcome Screen**: Beautiful branded login page with feature highlights
- **Required Authentication**: No more auto-login to "Unknown" users
- **Login/Register**: Users MUST create an account or login with existing credentials
- **Username Control**: Users choose their own username (minimum 3 characters)
- **Password Security**: SHA-256 hashed passwords for security

#### 2. **Account Management**
- **Change Username**: Users can change their username anytime (with password confirmation)
- **Change Password**: Update password securely
- **Switch Account**: Logout and login with different account (no restart required!)
- **Delete Account**: Permanently remove account and all data

#### 3. **Seamless UX**
- **Auto-Login**: Only for previously logged-in users (proper credential verification)
- **Instant Logout**: Immediately returns to login screen
- **Account Switching**: No restart needed - immediate account switching
- **Cloud Sync**: Each user gets their own private data space

## 🎯 **New User Experience:**

### **First-Time Users:**
1. App opens to beautiful welcome screen
2. User clicks "Login / Sign Up"
3. User creates account with chosen username and password
4. Immediately enters app with personal data space

### **Returning Users:**
1. App auto-logs in with saved credentials
2. If credentials invalid/changed, shows login screen
3. User can switch accounts anytime via sidebar

### **Account Management:**
- **Sidebar → Account Button** opens full account management
- Change username, password, switch account, or delete account
- All changes happen instantly without restart
